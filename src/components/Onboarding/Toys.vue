    li Ping pong can be a noise distraction to non-players, please be sensitive about beginning play when others are
    li Working/relaxing in the space. If its in the afternoon, ask the room first. People are often happy to re-locate work to the quieter back room if there&apos;s space and they are asked politely.
    li If you are the last to use the space at night, please return the table and chairs to &quot;work mode&quot; before leaving; rather than expecting the first people in to do this for you.
