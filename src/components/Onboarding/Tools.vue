    li Consult the wiki [still-to-do] to see if there is a defined protocol/owner for the eqpmt in question.
    li Put it back exactly how/where you found it.
    li If it is noisy, consult others in the space first and offer to close any doors between yourself and other occupants to help with noise control.
    li If prolonged and disruptive noise is expected (bigger projects), notify members via slack and organize a time in advance so that others know what to expect.
    li If it emits dust/dirt, make sure you sweep/vacuum afterwards. If this is impractical (multi-session projects) then apologize and notify people so they can plan accordingly.
    li If you break something, then notify the owner/group promptly and take it from there. Don&apos;t let it go un-noticed until later when it might cause more disappointment to others.
