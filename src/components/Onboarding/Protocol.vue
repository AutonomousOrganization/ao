    li Be calm in your communication. No yelling, name-calling, or loud arguing in the public spaces. Walk it off, take space, and contact the person later on.
    li We aim to teach and learn here-- don&apos;t make fun of people for not knowing something, or doing something wrong. Try to do things you don&apos;t know how to do with other people&apos;s equipment or projects.
    li Communicate openly about anything related to the space or collective. Do you see something broken? Are you unhappy with how something&apos;s being done? Do you have an amazing idea that will blow everyone&apos;s minds?
