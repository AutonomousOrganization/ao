  h1 SETTING UP EVENTS
  p To maintain consensus and organization as we scale, there need to be a few guidelines established for event scheduling:
  ul
    li Events can only be scheduled by active members
    li If you want to set up a new event that will be attended by non-members, please run it by the community on the Slack #events channel at least one week in advance
    li If you want to set up a weekly, recurring meetup, please propose it as an agenda item for our fortnightly members meetings
    li Once you&apos;re &quot;approved&quot; to host the event, you can access info on how to post it to our calendar and Meetup account-- you&apos;re likely to get higher attendance the earlier you advertise
  h2 For the actual event:
  ul
    li Show up at least 15 minutes before it&apos;s scheduled to start, and prop the door using the deadbolt-- often newcomers will trickle in early
    li Ideally, get the projector going, and show onscreen the wifi login and commonly asked questions [we&apos;ll set this up soon]
    li Either just before beginning, or at the very end, describe Decentral Commons, our mission, and membership-- offer to take down info for Slack/calendar invites, try to seek donations
    li Make sure the space is clean and everything is put back where you found it!
