  h2 Welcome to dctrl
  p todo
  p We are a do-ocracy, the dctrl collective encourages all participants to run with their cool ideas for events, space improvements, and general introduction of new ideas. By joining the space, have 24/7 access to one of the coolest locations in Vancouver, you'll also have the freedom and support to host your own meetups and events, to propose new collaborative projects and new equipment to potentially purchase.
  p The unique value add here, besides our focus on decentralization and disruptive technologies, is the fluidity of the space's use itself: you can co-work, incite political movements, create art, do programming, or just hang out in the evenings to "lounge." Most of all, you'll be a part of an exciting community holding diverse interests.
