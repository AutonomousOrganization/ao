  h1 what is membership
  ul
    li The meetings occur once a month at the space around 7pm, and are scheduled on the Decentral Google Calendar
    li If you can&apos;t make it in person, you&apos;re free to beam in via Google Hangouts, just let us know that you plan to ahead of time!
    li In general, don&apos;t wait for a monthly meeting to bring up new issues, write things down in the form of github issues or slack conversation; to save time the meetings should be mainly be about voting on existing issues
    li Meetings are not just for whining, if you come with problems, you should make an effort to also come with solutions and/or proposals to fix the situation.
    li Contribute any concerns or agenda items on the Slack active members channel in advance of the meeting, and we will work them into the agenda
    li Everyone is encouraged to collaborate on meeting notes on google docs so we get a well-rounded view of what goes on and what&apos;s decided. Before a meeting commences, it should be established which member will be publishing minutes (although everyone can contribute to the notes)
