  h2 Logistical Space Rules
  h3 Respect the Business that operates above us.
  ul
    li For now, we need to keep a low public profile [a la Red Gate Society etc]. 436 West Pender is a clubhouse which is separate from the entity of Decentral Commons. Please list all events as located at 436 West Pender accordingly.
    li This is a public shared space, not a crash pad or home. If you plan to store anything here short term, stash it out of the way, and if you want to keep things here long term, propose the details in the active members Slack channel.
    li Don&apos;t use tech equipment or tools that you are not familiar with, or that have not been clearly described as belonging to the larger collective
    li Don&apos;t engage in activities and pursuits that are dangerous, illegal, or reasonably likely to cause liability
    li If you have ideas for significant changes or renovations, propose them to the group, don&apos;t just go crazy on your own.
    li There&apos;s value to the hacker ethos of &quot;just get on with it&quot; for projects, but the clubhouse itself gets really chaotic if everything is constantly getting shifted and changed.
    li throw away trash, recycle, and do dishes before leaving for the night
    li try to move furniture etc. back where it was after activities
    li don&apos;t leave your stuff spread over a bunch of surfaces when you&apos;re not there
    li don&apos;t leave food behind in the fridge for more than a day or two
    li [We&apos;re still navigating the consensus around &quot;crashing in the space.&quot; If we do all agree that members can crash here occasionally, I propose that there be a required record of this-- if they plan ahead of time, put it in the Google Calendar; if they get too drunk and fall asleep, just give a heads up on Slack the next day. It&apos;s important that everyone knows what&apos;s going on, it probably won&apos;t be necessary to &quot;police&quot; this]
  h2 Keep the space secure:
  ul
    li always check that the magnet lock has fastened securely after you close the door
    li lock the deadbolt if you are the last person to leave (VERY IMPORTANT) never leave the deadbolt unlocked if there is no one in the space
    li let one of the main coordinators know ASAP if you lose your key/fob
    li unfortunately, there can be some rapscallions in the neighbourhood, so if someone just wanders in randomly, introduce yourself, find out why they&apos;re here, and don&apos;t leave them alone in the space
    li alert the active members channel to any suspicious activity accordingly
    li Maintain open communication with others when using the same space-- respect basic expectations of courteousness and noise levels. [Excluding cries of victory during ping pong games!]
  h2 Keep it clean and organized
    li Clean up after yourself:
